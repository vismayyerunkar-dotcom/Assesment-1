# 🧮 Commission Calculator — Technical Assessment

> Finish and ship a production-quality Commission Calculator for **Avalpha Technologies**.  
> The API and React app are scaffolded; the controller exists but the logic & wiring are incomplete **by design**.

---

## 🚀 What you’ll build

- Connect **frontend (React)** ↔ **backend (C#/.NET)**  
- Implement commission calculations in the C# controller  
- Deliver clean, production-ready code (tests, structure, readability)

⏱ **Timebox:** up to **4 hours max**. Be pragmatic. Prioritize correctness, clarity, and the essentials.

## 🔀 Before you start (Fork + Setup)

1. **Fork** this repository into your own GitHub account.  
2. **Clone** your fork locally.  
3. Work in a feature branch, e.g. `feat/commission-impl`.  
4. When done, push to your fork and open a **Pull Request** back to your fork’s `main`.  
   - Add a short **README-notes.md** describing decisions, trade-offs, and anything unfinished.  
5. Share your fork/PR link with us.

> ✅ We want to see how you think, structure, and ****. Small, meaningful commits > one giant commit.

## 🧠 Business Rules

At **Avalpha Technologies**:
- **Local Sales Commission:** **20%**
- **Foreign Sales Commission:** **35%**

Competitors pay:
- **Local:** **2%**
- **Foreign:** **7.55%**

**Inputs:**
- `localSalesCount` (number)  
- `foreignSalesCount` (number)  
- `averageSaleAmount` (currency/number)  

**Output (example):**

Local Sales count: 10
Foreign Sales count: 10
Average Sales Amount: £100

Avalpha Commission:

Local = 20% * 10 * 100 = £200

Foreign = 35% * 10 * 100 = £350

Total = £550

Competitor Commission:

Local = 2% * 10 * 100 = £20

Foreign = 7.55% * 10 * 100 = £75.5

Total = £95.5

## 🧩 Your Tasks (Checklist)

- [ ] Wire up the **React frontend** to call the backend API  
- [ ] Implement calculation logic 
- [ ] Validate inputs (numbers ≥ 0, sensible upper bounds)  
- [ ] Return a typed, well-structured response (DTO)  
- [ ] Display results in the UI with clear labels and currency formatting  
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (backend & UI)  
- [ ] Provide basic **docs**: how to run, how to test, decisions  
- [ ] Keep commits small and messages clear

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite/CRA), TypeScript preferred (if scaffolded), Fetch/Axios OK  
- **Backend:** .NET (C#), minimal API or MVC controller  
- **Tests:** xUnit/NUnit + React Testing Library / Vitest/Jest

✅ Notes on My Implementation

Connected the React UI to the .NET backend using a small API layer to keep network logic out of components.

Implemented commission calculation in the backend using the Strategy pattern so new commission rules can be added without changing existing logic.

Added validation on both frontend and backend to prevent negative or invalid inputs.

Used a custom React hook to handle API calls, loading state, and avoid duplicate requests.

Wrote focused tests:

Backend tests cover calculation logic and edge cases.

Frontend tests focus on rendering, user interaction, and validation (business logic is tested outside the UI).

Kept the solution simple and production-ready within the timebox, prioritizing clarity and extensibility over over-engineering.
